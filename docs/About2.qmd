I am currently a Senior At Colorado State University, perusing my Bachelor's degree in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability. I look to peruse a career in Wildlife law enforcement after gradation. Below you will find a link to the Alexander Mountain Fire. I was able to assist in evacuations and area patrol during this fire.
